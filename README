NAME

QTIBox

SUMMARY

A plugin for Edshare which allows QTI items to be previewed.

REQUIREMENTS

-	An Edshare (or possibly EPrints) installation.
-	An instance of QTIEngine to call (uses the demonstration version at 
	qtiengine.qtitools.org by default)

INSTALLATION

The files should be extracted to <eprintsroot>/archives/<archivename>/ and then 
a symlink to the cgi/qtibox_playitem file added to the <eprintsroot>/cgi 
directory.

It's safe to extract all files but in fact only those listed in the file 
qtibox.manifest are required.

CONFIGURATION

No configuration should be necessary but the host of the QTIEngine instance to 
be called can be changed by altering the variable near the top of the 
cgi/qtibox_playitem file.

USAGE

The box appears on the abstract page of any EPrint whose first document is seen 
to be a valid QTI XML file or QTI content package. Clicking the "play item" 
button uploads the item to the QTIEngine instance and then replaces the contents 
of the box with an iframe pointing to QTIEngine's preview.

CAVEATS

Only the first document of each EPrint is currently considered.
